# Docker-compose

## What is docker-compose

``Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration``

## Use cases

* Development
* automated testing
* single dockerhost, multiple containers

## difference with Dockerfile

Dockerfile defines how the container will be build (created).

Compose defines how the container will be run.

* docker run
* docker volume
* docker network

...all these typical docker commands get replaced by a compose file.

## Compose versions and references

Compose exists in multiple versions.

Syntax is fairly backwards compatible, but you have to check what version your docker engine supports.
Version 2 is currently the most universal working version.
