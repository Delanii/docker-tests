### docker compose can be used for 2 things:

Building multi-container apps
running multi-container apps

#install
sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y

#getting the app

wget https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app/archive/master.zip

sudo apt-get install unzip -y
unzip master.zip
cd example-voting-app-master/

### Building

first we use docker-compose to build the app containers
in the folder we run:

sudo docker-compose build

# docker-compose up

sudo docker-compose up
###when running the command you will see:
"Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node."
so yes docker compose will run the multi-container app but all containers will be running on swarm1
we can do better then that

we can open the app on: http://swarm1.watteel.lan:5000/
and on 5001 we can see the results of the votes
