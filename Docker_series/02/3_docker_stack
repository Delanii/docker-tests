### with docker stack we cannot BUILD containers we can only deploy them over a swarm cluster
so the containers must exists premade with docker-compose

we can however deploy a "stack with the same docker-compose.yml file"
caveat: "must be compose version 3"

sudo docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml vote

we can now open our app on any node on port 5000

try it

http://swarm3.watteel.lan:5000/

this is because of docker swarms service mech, more about that in another video

if you refresh your web browser, you will see the container ID changes as the load is balanced between two nodes
